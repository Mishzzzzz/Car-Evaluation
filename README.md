# Car-Evaluation

This model predicts the quality of the used car whether it is in a good state, very good state, accepted state, or not accepted.

The car evaluation model has two files,
1- car_data.csv which is the dataset used for training the classification model. The dataset can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation
2- car_evaluation.ipynb which contains the code for the classification.
